# My Python Learning Journey

Hello and welcome to my Python coding repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is a collection of my personal projects, exercises, and code snippets as I learn and grow my skills in Python. I'm documenting my progress here, one commit at a time. The goal is to build a portfolio of work, reinforce new concepts, and have a place to revisit code I've written.

## Repository Structure

I'm organizing my projects by topic or date to keep everything tidy and easy to find. Each folder represents a new concept or project I've worked on.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring the code or want to try running any of the scripts yourself, you can clone this repository to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run these Python scripts, you'll need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.

### How to Clone

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
